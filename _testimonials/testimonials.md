This was an uncomplicated sale with a willing seller and a willing buyer. The offer price was fair and no conditions of note required. The agency staff were the conduit for a speedy and painless sale/ purchase process. Common sense and attention to requests for information were evident in the short negotiation period. Very happy with manner and result.

Hi Just a quick note to express our delight in working with Tamara ,Therese and team on this purchase we very very impressed of the professional approch.

Dennis and Fiona - Bayview Heights
3 very lovely ladies that are very helpful. Thank you for everything!

Kayla - Bentley Park
I could not speak more highly of these amazing 3 women. They are truly miracle makers!! I would not go past Ray White Cairns Central for either selling; buying or renting your home.

Sharon - Bentley Park
Having built this home and decorated it in a style that was rather unique, we knew that there may be a challenge ahead of us with selling. From our very first meeting with Therese, we knew that we had employed a true professional in her field, and also a lady who saw huge potential to selling our home. Like Therese, Jody was always there for us or only a quick phone call away. Her dedication and honesty along with her never ending positive attitude and friendliness made selling our home a stress free experience. The result being a better than expected price. Therese, Jody and Tamara are highly skilled, supportive and committed and I would have no hesitation in recommending Therese Plath and her amazing team. Thank you !

Jack and Jo - Bentley Park
We are so grateful and happy with the results of our sale, our experience with the team was positive at all times. We can't thank them enough for the manner and expertise they handled the sale of our house.

Gary and Valarie - Edmonton
It has been a pleasure to deal with your company. It is great to deal with people whom have the same enthusiasm as we do in customer satisfaction. I would like to make special mention towards Jodie Kneebone who has corresponded with us through the whole process and has been available on numerous occasions to show us through the house and has been on hand for our every phone call. Should we ever need to purchase a house again, you can expect our phone call. But don't hold your breath because we think you have sold us the best. Brendan and Paula and family.

Brendan and Paula - Edmonton
Therese Plath's local knowledge is outstanding, she is always professional & offers great advice. We are very happy with Therese & her team also.

Gary and Di - Edmonton
Could not have asked for more!!! When we decided to sell our home we already knew who we wanted and we were certainly not disappointed. Our initial meeting with Therese, Jodie & Tamara inspired nothing but confidence in regards to selling our home. We were given extremely helpful and informative information which left us with no questions needing to be asked. We were very fortunate to sell our home within a week of it being listed and I have no doubt that this was due to the professional and enthusiastic approach that Therese, Jodie and Tamara display. We would highly recommend Therese and her team to anyone who is looking to sell or buy as we truly believe you would be dealing with Cairns' number one real estate agent.

Chris and Steve
Hi Therese, Jodie and Tamara. It is with pleasure that I write to you all, to thank you for putting in the hard yards and effort to achieve the sale of my home at 11 Roma Close Forest Gardens. Therese I appreciate your professional approach and willingness to assist me with a difficult decision that had to be made. Mine was an difficult home to market and sell, being not of the normal desired 3 bed 2 bath configuration and a one off design in todays difficult times. Through your hard work and professional approach you achieved the sale at an acceptable figure, whereas another well know Estate Agent here in Cairns could not even attract one person in 12 weeks of listing to view my home. It was not a quick sale with the home on and off the market over a long period of time, but that was partly my fault as the first firm offer you ever approached me with was right on the mark for the market. Therese, you, and your willing, hard working associates Jodie up front and personal, and Tamara beavering away in the office, were the epitome of professional marketing at all times, especially as I had no budget for advertising at all. I thank you for your professional willing and at all times pleasant approach to a difficult task. Gratefully yours

Phil Crockford
We would like to take this opportunity to thank Therese & Jodie for their support during the sale process of our house, in a slower market than we have been used to over the recent years. Both Therese & Jodie continue to be proactive in searching for our next dream property, and we respect their professional can-do attitudes. Their assistance is greatly appreciated and we have formed a wonderful ongoing working relationship with them, and would not hesitate recommending them to anyone purchasing or selling a property.

Sam & Belinda
What excellent service and professionalism. We did not think we were going to have difficulties selling our Defence House Australia (DHA) investment home in Cairns. However, things don't always go to plan do they? Living in Melbourne and selling in Cairns was a challenge in itself. Having no luck with the first agent, it was a blessing to find another agent willing to take up the challenge. However, to sell the home was going to take something extra, which Therese and the team demonstrated willingly. They demonstrated over and above the role as agent to ensure the home was presentable on open days and inspection appointments. Always available to communicate and in the end, I felt like a friend sold my home for us, not an agent trying to meet their target sales for the month. The sale resulted in a win win for all parties and I would recommend Therese and the team to anyone wishing to sell their home and wanting that little bit extra to make the experience a good one. Thank you Therese and team for your professionalism, warm friendly approach to your clients and going the extra mile which resulted in the ultimate outcome - HOUSE SOLD.

Ian and Lili Robinson
We found Therese, Jodie and Tamara of Ray White Central very dedicated and helpful in both buying our new house and selling our previous one. Their friendly, personal approach provided us with constant feedback and flexibility with advertising and 'Open House' situations. With perserverence and determination, they achieved a realistic price for us, considering the difficult market in which we were buying and selling. We were very satisfied with the teams services and would recommend them to others.

Michael and Kath O'Halloran
"I recently had the pleasure of listing my Kanimbla Hts home with Ray White, Aplin St, Cairns. Therese Plath and her Team of dedicated professionals were just that - Courteous, prompt, informative and efficient from the first day we met until sale. Therese Plath has vast experience in the Cairns Real Estate Market and was able to provide me with a broad range of marketing strategies to suit my needs. My house sold within 4 weeks of advertisement, while numerous other houses listed prior to mine in surrounding suburbs remained unsold by other agents. I was extremely happy with the final sale price, with Therese negotiating a higher settlement figure than I first anticipated. I have no hesitation in recommending Therese Plath and her team from Ray White, to anyone wishing to sell their property

Brett Mackenzie
We wish to thank the team at Ray White Real Estate Cairns Central for all their dedication and hard work. Selling a house can be a very stressful experience however Therese, Jodie and the team showed us commitment and a very professional approach at all times. We appreciate their keeping us constantly updated and informed throughout the whole process and also their effort to achieve very close to our asking price. I would recommend Ray White Cairns to anyone considering selling or buying. Once again thanks so much, we really appreciate everything you have done.

Scott & Brenda Suter
This note is a very belated thank you for all your assistance in the purchase of our new home in Forest Gardens.We have been in our home two weeks already and are slowly settling in (still have to unpack about 30 boxes)!!Just wanted to say it was lovely dealing with you and to thank you for your kindness to both Derek and myself. We really do love our new home and are very happy with everything! Thank you again and we will certainly be in touch if we ever need to sell and move on. Our daughter also may be looking for a unit towards the end of this year, so we will contact you as the time draws closer.

Maureen & Derek Worthy
Therese and her team gems in the real estate world. Purchasing a property with Therese was a pleasant and a winning experience. I also would like to thank the previous owner for enlisting her gorgeous property with Therese, as I now have met the most caring, honest & professional Real Estate agents in Cairns. Whether you have a flat battery or your husband works away and getting a contract signed becomes an issue, their reassurance that everything will be alright, helped my husband and I purchase our new property. I would like to say a special thank you to Therese and her team as they did go the extra mile for us and I have no hesitation in recommending them to all our family and friends.

Jackie Newell & Gabe
Wayne and I would like to Thank you for your professionalism,effort and care you have given us from day one, when Ray White took over from another real estate to looked after our investment property. We knew we made the right decision, the care and service we received was just excellent. What an amazing team!!! They stayed in touch with us throughout the whole process of selling our property, our home and purchasing our new home. We highly recommend Therese and her team either selling or purchasing your home :)

Wayne & Mary Boylett
What a beautiful surprise – so unique and totally unexpected – thank you so much. I have just had the fenced moved back to give us more garden – so the gift voucher will come in very useful. Thank you both for the amount of unseemly tireless energy and effort put into achieving our dream.

Chris & Ron Thompson
From the start we were impressed by Therese Plath's warm friendly approach, she and Jodie make a great team and catered to our personalised needs. With two young children flexibility and understanding of my needs was essential, both Therese and Jodie knew exactly how to help. A steady detailed flow of information about potential buyers, the local market and information on a wide scale was always at hand to keep myself and family informed. Therese brings a wealth of knowledge, professionalism, and calmness to the sale process. Jodie presents an energetic approach with a wonderful positive attitude who is a delight to welcome into our home to assist with the sale process. With persistence and determination, Therese and Jodie made the sale for us in what is a tough market at the moment. We were very satisfied with the end result and having Therese and her team as our sale agents has been a absolute pleasure.

Kim Ingham
We found Therese and Jodie to be a fantastic team. They constantly stayed in touch with us throughout the whole process. Perhaps most importantly, they provided sound advice, guidance and options on the best direction and then gave us time to make up our own mind without any pressure. I would thoroughly recommend Therese and Jodie to anyone looking to sell their house for the best price in the current market.

Don and Katy Mckay
Giving Sole Agency for the sale of my home to Ray White Cairns Central was a very wise move indeed. Therese Plath and her assistants e looked after me in such a kind and professional manner, I would certainly recommend them to anyone contemplating selling their property. They guided me through the process which resulted in a sale in just a few short weeks. They made what can be a very stressful time a lot easier and I still think of them as friends. I am grateful to them both for their caring attitude towards me.

Wendy Knox
Who would have thought that selling your "castle" could be so pain free? When we decided to buy another home in Cairns that would be suited to our needs, it was necessary for us to sell our lovely little home in Bayview Heights. A friend had suggested contacting Therese and her team, as they had been impressed with the service provided when marketing their property. After discussing the sale and showing our home to Therese, who was more than happy to work into our schedule, and signing the necessary paperwork, Therese contacted persons who she knew were interested in property in the area. From this contact, and a small advertisement which was placed in the Saturday Realtor, the property was shown and sold within 4 days!! We never felt pressured or manipulated, and were very thankful for the professional advice and guidance that we received from both Therese and Jodie. They made what could have been a stressful process easy, efficient and effective. If we ever buy or sale real estate in this area in the future, we will be heading straight to Therese Plath and her team at Ray White Central Cairns.

Colleen Steel
What an exciting experience!! Selling a house with Therese was so wonderful. When we put the house on the market with Ray White Central we had no idea how passionate, how professional and how organized Therese was. We spoke with Therese, who organized a caravan of other agents to see our house the next day. We were really impressed to see the agents immediately on the phone, contacting their list of customers.Therese sold our house after two open homes over two to three weeks. We sold the house for a price that was over what we expected in this current market. We would highly recommend Therese, her staff and Ray White Central. A great bunch of people.

Sandy & Gavin
We just wanted to say we felt confident with Therese as the agent we were purchasing our home from. Therese was always helpful in answering our questions and not only did she always operate professionally but she also made us feel like we were friends.

Deanne and Brett Duncan
Please accept our sincere thanks for your professionalism, genuine care and attention to details in the sale of our home and purchase of an investment home. Selling and moving home can be very stressful, you made us feel comfortable and relaxed and provided a confidence to us that all the details were being taken care of. Your commitment to quality in all you have done for us is much appreciated. There are lots of little things that have meant a lot to us, the way you took an interest in our children and indeed our pets. Letting our dog Murphy out of his cage after open homes showed your care and attention without being asked. These little things are the reason we will continue to utilise your services Therese both now and into the future. Despite having already moved interstate, your professionalism continued in meeting our every requirement including facilitating all facets of purchasing our investment house. At all times we felt confident that we were kept fully informed and any enquiries were promptly dealt with. Once again, thankyou Therese for all your hard work Kind Regards, Patrick and Linda Korman and family.

Patrick and Linda Korman and family
We would just like to say a big thank you to both of you for the brilliant service when we purchased our home from you. You both made us all feel so comfortable and we both were very pleased that there was no pressure to buy. You both made us feel like family and not just another client, and that is very important. We are very pleased with our new home and thank you both for finding it for us, I am sure it will bring many years of memories for us all. The service from your office is outstanding, our calls were always returned very quickly. Many, many thanks, Bruce, Lesa, Brenden and Cindy

Bruce, Lesa, Brenden and Cindy
Hi Therese Mum has asked me to let both you and Jodie know how much she appreciates the work you have both put into assisting her to sell her home in Arno Terrace and move on with the next stage of her life. I would also like to express my appreciation of your efforts and the way that you interacted with Mum during the difficult times the market has been going through lately and the efforts to get the best price possible for her. Thanks again Michelle and Faye

Michelle Gaffney
We sold our home through Therese Plath, at Ray White Cairns Central and it was a pleasure to do Business with her team. Their Ethics Experience and Professional service was very reassuring, they gave 100%. Their Friendly honest approach, nothing was any trouble what more would you want, marvellous. Thank you Therese, Jodie and Jess. Max and Lyn King.

Max & Lyn King
Nick and I went through an open home, on a Saturday and we received a follow up call on the Monday to see how we liked the home. Although it was a nice home it did not meet our requirements. After speaking with the team, they did not press us further in relation to the property, but were very friendly and personable. We then decided we would build and were in the process of finding house plans to suit. We received a call from Therese's team to let us know they had a property which had just been listed and which they were sure would meet our needs. To be quite honest we almost didn't bother looking at the property as we had our heart set on building because we could not find a home that suited our situation. After driving past on the Wednesday, we asked for an inspection on the Thursday and we were so glad we did as it had all the features we desired as well as extra bonus features that just sweetened the deal. We loved it so much, we put a contract on the house on the Friday. Therese and her team did a wonderful job for her vendor by quickly matching their house with a customer whose needs were met. In summary we received nothing but friendly, professional service. Thank You, Nick and Karen

Nick & Karen
We will highly recommend Therese, Jodie and team to any friends and colleagues interested in selling their home. Therese and Jodie were extremely professional, considerate of our needs and provided excellent feedback throughout the selling process. We are aware we had an unusual property that wasn't an easy sell, yet it was sold well within our time frame and the projected average sale time for acreage properties. Thanks you so much for all your support and nurturing during what is generally a stressful time for most families.

Kelly McCafferty
Our experience with Ray White Cairns Central was one that was friendly and professional. Therese, Jodie and Jess displayed a can do attitude and nothing was ever too much trouble. Jodie's passion for her job and positive attitude was a breath of fresh air. Thank you Therese, Jodie and Jess for your assistance in selling our first home.

Matthew & Belinda Crawford
Therese, Jodie and Tamara, Thank you again for selling our City View home. Having purchased the house through Therese Plath in 2005 we were fully aware of her negotiation skills and confident that she and her team understood all of our wonderful homes greatest features. In a slow buyers market your team managed to get us numerous offers with three being acceptable. When one contract fell over, and then a second, you continued to market and promote the property. When our deadline was imminent you all went the extra mile cultivated more offers and secured a third contract which has now settled. In spite of a terrible market, tenant issues and the obstructions of a couple of other agents we always had confidence in your honesty, professionalism and dedication to selling our home. Our old home now has a wonderful new owner thanks to your great efforts. There are no other agents I am recommending to friends and we remain very grateful for your understanding and enthusiasm throughout the sale process.

Cameron and Rebecca
She was very personal, caring, experienced and an amazing lady. Would never sell or buy a property without her. She was like my mum away from mum in the process of my sale and my purchase.

Rodney and Terri
This is the third time I have listed a property with Therese because I like her style, she has a professional manner, hard working and very approachable.

Louise and Gary
Therese is a very experienced agent, who holds our complete trust in her work ethic, honesty and commitment to achieve the best results possible.

Walter and Di
Kept informed at all times, positive result in short time, a very polite manner, lovely person.

Peter and Kathleen
Therese has sold a number of properties for us and she has always provided honest and respectful advice when dealing with us and we were always fully aware of what was going on. We would not consider listing a property with any other real estate. I would also like to mention Jodie Kneebone and Tamara West who assist Therese and her commitment to selling our property.

Ian and Michelle
We couldn't recommend Therese Plath enough when it comes to selling realestate. Not only is she a lovely lady but she has so much experience in the industry that really helped to sell our property. Therese doesn't just wait for potential buyers to come through your house, she maintains a data base of people looking to buy from the Cairns region, interstate and overseas. She uses this database to match up your house with potential buyers. This is why she was able to sell our property in just 36hrs.

Brett and Katie
Hi Therese Jodie & Tamara, Just a Short note to thank you for your assistance during the purchase of our new property. As I am sure your aware purchasing a new property can sometimes be a traumatic experience fortunately you made the experience quite pleasant , Pam and I would like to thank you for the professional manner the transaction was conducted.

John & Pam
The whole selling experience with Therese Plath and her team at Ray White Cairns Central was first class. From the initial consultation, determining advertising requirements, open house displays through to the finalisation of sale, everything was managed and executed professionally. No request was too big or too hard. Communication was first class and I was kept reliably informed along the sale path. Regular discussion were held on specific strategies to achieve the best price in the quickest time all to serve the needs of the client. Tireless weekends were spent doing open homes and following up on leads generated. The next time I need to sell a property the first phone call will be to Ray White Cairns Central. If you require your property sold with a minimum of fuss and bother then leave it in the very capable hands of Therese Plath and the team at Ray White Cairns Central. I thoroughly recommend them.

Rick Stella
Rob & I have found Therese and Jodie wonderful to deal with. As you know, we have bought and sold many properties in and around Cairns since 1993 and during this time we have experienced many different agents during various stages of the markets highs and lows. This market has certainly been another one of the toughest, in which you guided and recommended what course of action we should take and helped achieve a sale for us! Your regular phone calls and updates were excellent, as well as your punctuality with appointments, as we have found in the past that this does not occur with other agents. To us, this is the absolute key area of importance which makes you stand out and shine above the rest. I happened to see a sign when I was in Victoria recently and it was a real estate agents sign which said "the red carpet experience".....I believe that we experienced that with you! (Keep us in mind if you come across any ''bargains of the century'' as we are always looking for opportunities!

Rob & Judy Jackson
Thank you for selling our home so quickly at the very best price - we are very happy with the result. You and your office communicated with us so well, we knew exactly what was happening and when in regards to the marketing of our property. Therese and Jodie you exceeded our expectations on every level making the process so smooth. Your kindness and genuine care for our family has been really lovely and greatly appreciated. We look forward to having a long standing relationship with you and your office in our Real Estate futures.

Sarah Williams and Robert Willmett
Having spent around 20 years as a bank manager I have had extensive contact with many Real Estate agents and Therese is the most professional and principled that I have had the pleasure of working with. When signing the sole agency agreement, we agreed to a sale price range for our property, a marketing strategy and the type of client base that would be suited to our home. In a very tough depressed market Therese remained firm to her plan and constantly kept us informed. Our property was sold by Therese within our price range in a very competitive market. This is only the second testimonial I have provided for someone that has not worked for me. I put considerable importance on providing a testimonial but is was not a difficult decision in this instance as Therese knows her market is very much a hands-on person and will not comprise her business principles no matter how hard the market is.

Roger Steedman
We want to thank Jodie and Therese for the wonderful service we received from Ray White Cairns Central. We put our house on the market at a time when the market was depressed, and even with these conditions Jodie and Therese sold our house within our time frame and at the right price. The service we received, we believe was above what we would have received from some other agents. The ladies seemed to go the extra mile and make an otherwise stressful transaction as smooth as possible. Thanks Jodie and Therese.

Jason & Amy Bender
Remembering, when you need a lawyer you don't shop price, when you look for a surgeon, you certainly don't shop price. Now i know when you sell a home you don't shop price.

Faye Warnock
One makes good decisions and some not so good. But, one of the best decisions I have made was to enlist Therese Plath to sell my home. Therese, I thank you most sincerely for all your help in finding just the right buyer. The attention you gave to my situation was greatly appreciated. Your professionalism, integrity and patience were evident from the outset, making the sale a pleasurable experience. Thank you for achieving a very satisfactory price, and your effort to ensure a smooth and speedy settlement. I would certainly recommend you to family and friends, whether they be selling or buying in the future. They can be assured of your courteous and helpful attention.

Lorel Le Galloudec
Therese, you are arguably the best negotiator I have come across after 10 years in real estate when achieving the maximum sale price for your vendors. It never ceases to amaze me your ability and your sheer professionalism in real estate has deservingly rewarded you with countless accolades to which I have admired over the years. You are kind hearted, thoughtful and sincere, and this wonderful personality shines through to everyone around you. I sincerely wish you continued success in every aspect of your life. All the very best for the future!

Col Hancox
My husband and four children moved to Cairns in January 08 and started looking for the "perfect house" We tried several Real-estate Agents but weren''t impressed with the service. We then had the good fortune to try Ray White Central and found a business that offered complete honesty, integrity, and an attitude where nothing is to much trouble. Therese Plath and Jodie Kneebone went to extraordinary trouble to find us a lovely family home, Kept us up to date regularly with progress and we had a trouble free settlement. We would love to thank them both for their input, kindness and friendship and would firmly recommend their service and assistance to everyone! P.S.... A big thankyou once again for your beautiful "Welcome" gift, it looks gorgeous in our home!

The Sleeman Family
Once again we would like to reiterate that we are very appreciative for the efforts you have both put into this property and look forward to listing more properties with your Business in the future. I will also refer any family or friends who are looking to sell a property to yourselves due to your high level of customer service.

Wayen & Mikayla Duda
Before selling our house, we did a lot of research on who we thought would represent us best. Therese Plath was the stand out choice, and we were right. Therese, Jodie and the rest of her team offered a professional, experienced service that, in our opinion, is unrivalled in Cairns. Honest advice, a genuine appraisal and constant feedback during the selling process is what we received. In this world, you get what you pay for, and Therese achieves results. You can''t ask for more than that.

Sharon & Simon Wilson
When marketing our home recently after consideration of many agents we confidently contracted Therese Plath from Ray White Central to sell our home. Therese is a very professional, honest, down to earth, caring person, and as with all her team, was always considerate, approachable and diligent in keeping us informed. Therese achieved the desired result within an intensely competitive market and in our opinion if you are seriously wanting the best available, you can't do better than Therese and her team and we have no hesitancy in recommending her to anyone either wanting to list or buy a home.
