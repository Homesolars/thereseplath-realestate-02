Positive, energetic, bubbly, honest, enthusiastic and self motivated are just a few attributes used to describe Jodie Kneebone. Jodie with her vivacious personality was given a golden opportunity over eight years ago to train under one of Queensland’s most successful and exceptional consultants, Therese Plath. This makes this an enviable team which sets a high standard of professionalism above all. You will feel as though you have known and respected them for years.

Jodie’s journey into real estate has had one simple focus which was to strive to an unsurpassed level of client service based on integrity and results with a strong work ethic and “can do” attitude. Buying and Selling your greatest asset can be a stressful experience and Jodie is very passionate about knowing Therese’s clients are being looked after efficiently, professionally and with their best interests at heart. Jodie knows the importance of dedication, hard word and most importantly Customer Service.

Having worked in the hospitality and customer service industry, Jodie sets a high standard which is all she knows after working alongside Therese Plath for so long. With the combined skills of Therese, Jodie and Tamara, their vision together is to provide seamless customer service for every client and continue to raise standards in the Cairns Real Estate Industry and make sure our clients achieve their desired outcomes.
